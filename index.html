 <h1><center>Home Life</center></h1>
 
 <center><p id="niner">My name is Jacob Sernoff though people either call me <i>Jake</i> or by my actual name. I live with both parents and my brother 
 where we are an interesting bunch. My family is like your traditional house hold with some changes. My father 
 can be described as a Friendly,Hardworking and entertaining man by some of
 his best frie john ,maY6ORR
 nds and family. My mother on the other hand acts very different than my father,although she is hardworking she is less friendly and much more quiet. My Brother is
 very different from me, he is very sociable and is quite timid. He is only 10 years old but he probably acts like a 13 year old, he has a high sophistication level and we both
 like a lot of the same things.</p></center>
